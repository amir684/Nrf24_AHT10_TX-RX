# Nano_Nrf24_AHT10_TX

### Wireless Environmental Monitoring System with nRF24L01+

This project is a lightweight, battery-friendly wireless monitoring system using **Arduino**, **AHT10**, and **nRF24L01+** modules. It includes a single transmitter and two types of receivers:

---

## 🛰️ Components

### 1. **Transmitter**  
- **Hardware**: Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V 8MHz + AHT10 + nRF24L01+  
- **Function**: Reads temperature, humidity, and battery voltage. Sends packets over nRF24.  
- **Power Efficient**: Designed for long-term battery operation.

### 2. **Receiver with OLED**  
- **Hardware**: Arduino Nano + nRF24L01+ + OLED 128x32  
- **Function**: Receives and displays data in real-time:  
  • Temperature (°C)  
  • Humidity (%)  
  • Battery Voltage (V)  
  • Message Count & Timeout Since Last Message

### 3. **Receiver with MQTT**  
- **Hardware**: ESP8266 (e.g. Wemos D1 Mini) + nRF24L01+  
- **Function**: Receives packets and publishes them to an MQTT broker in JSON format for Home Assistant or similar platforms.

## 📡 Communication
All nodes use **nRF24L01+** and a shared address (pipe 0) for data transmission.
